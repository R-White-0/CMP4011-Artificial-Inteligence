%Arithmetic_Exercise 

/* a. Write a prolog program bank_customer/0 that will request the following information for a customer: 
1. Customer Name 
2. Customer Category (c1,c2 or c3) 
3. Beginning balance. 
4. Total deposits for the month 
5. Total withdrawals for the month  

For positive pre-interest balances(0 (beginning balance + monthly deposit â€“ monthly withdrawals)

 Interest is calculated based on the customer category as follows: 
                      Category  	Interest 
c1  		7% of positive pre-interest balance  
c2  		6% of positive pre-interest balance 
c3  		4% of positive pre-interest balance 

The program should calculate the final balance (pre-interest balance + Interest) and 
display the customerâ€™s name, interest amount and final balance.  
This program should also continue to run until the user gives the option to quit.
